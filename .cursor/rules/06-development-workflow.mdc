# Development Workflow

This repository uses pnpm as its package manager and follows a monorepo structure. Here are the key commands and workflows for development.

## Setup

To set up the project, install dependencies using:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Common Commands

- **Build**: `pnpm build` - Builds all packages
- **Test**: `pnpm test` - Runs tests for all packages
- **Watch Tests**: `pnpm test:watch` - Runs tests in watch mode
- **Type Checking**: `pnpm typecheck` - Runs TypeScript type checking
- **Lint**: `pnpm lint` - Runs ESLint on all packages
- **Fix Lint Issues**: `pnpm lint:fix` - Fixes auto-fixable ESLint issues
- **Format Code**: `pnpm prettier` - Formats code with Prettier
- **Clean**: `pnpm clean` - Cleans build artifacts and dependencies

## Working with Individual Packages

You can run commands for specific packages by navigating to their directories:

```bash
cd packages/browser
pnpm test
```

## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The following workflows are configured:

- [Test](mdc:.github/workflows/test.yml): Runs tests
- [Build](mdc:.github/workflows/build.yml): Builds the project
- [Lint](mdc:.github/workflows/lint.yml): Lints the code
- [Typecheck](mdc:.github/workflows/typecheck.yml): Checks types

These workflows run automatically on pull requests and pushes to the main branch.
